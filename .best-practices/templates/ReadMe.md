# [Specialty Name] Best Practices

## 1. Purpose

- Why this specialty matters in solution architecture.
- Key risks if ignored.

## 2. Core Principles

- List 3–5 guiding principles (e.g., "Prefer composition over inheritance" for software design, or "Encrypt data in transit and at rest" for security).

## 3. Industry Standards & Frameworks

- Relevant standards, frameworks, or certifications (e.g., OWASP Top 10, TOGAF, ITIL, ISO 27001).
- Note if there are cloud-provider reference architectures (AWS Well-Architected, Azure CAF, GCP Architecture Framework).

## 4. Common Patterns

- Typical design or implementation patterns used in this specialty.
- Example: For **Integration**, list "API Gateway, Event-Driven, CQRS".

## 5. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Known pitfalls or outdated practices.
- Example: For **DevOps**, "Snowflake servers, manual deployments".

## 6. Tooling & Ecosystem

- Widely adopted tools, libraries, or platforms.
- Example: For **Data Engineering**, "dbt, Airflow, Kafka".

## 7. Emerging Trends

- What’s changing in the next 2–3 years.
- Example: For **Security**, "Shift-left security, confidential computing".

## 8. Architecture Decision Guidance

- When to involve a specialist.
- Key trade-offs to consider.
- Example: "If latency <10ms is required, consider edge computing vs. centralized cloud."

## 9. References

- Authoritative links (standards bodies, cloud providers, industry groups).
- Keep lightweight but credible.
