# Web Instructions

## Scope
Applies to web development including HTML, CSS, frontend frameworks, and web applications.

## HTML Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO.
- Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6).
- Use appropriate ARIA labels and roles for screen readers.
- Validate HTML markup using W3C validator.
- Optimize for performance with appropriate meta tags.

## CSS Organization
- Use CSS methodology like BEM or utility-first approaches.
- Organize styles using consistent naming conventions.
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming.
- Implement mobile-first responsive design.
- Use efficient selectors and avoid deep nesting.

## JavaScript Frameworks
- Use modern JavaScript features (ES6+) consistently.
- Implement proper component lifecycle management.
- Use state management patterns appropriately.
- Optimize bundle sizes with code splitting.
- Follow framework-specific best practices and conventions.

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize HTTP requests and optimize resource loading.
- Use appropriate image formats and compression.
- Implement lazy loading for images and components.
- Optimize CSS and JavaScript bundle sizes.
- Use CDN for static assets when appropriate.

## Accessibility Standards
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility.
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation support.
- Use sufficient color contrast ratios.
- Provide alternative text for images and media.
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools.

## Security Best Practices
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
- Implement proper CORS configuration.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Validate and sanitize data on both client and server sides.

## SEO Optimization

- Use flexible grid systems and responsive units.
- Implement appropriate breakpoints for different devices.
- Test across multiple devices and screen sizes.
- Use responsive images and media queries effectively.

## Testing Strategies
- Unit test business logic and utility functions.
- Integration test user interactions and workflows.
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency.
- Cross-browser testing for compatibility.
- Performance testing for loading times and responsiveness.

## Development Workflow
- Use version control with meaningful commit messages.
- Implement proper build processes with task automation.
- Use linting tools for code quality consistency.
- Implement hot reloading for development efficiency.
- Use environment-specific configurations.

## Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- Implement service workers for offline functionality.
- Use web app manifests for installable experiences.
- Implement proper caching strategies.
- Provide offline fallbacks for critical functionality.
- Test PWA functionality across different devices.

## Modern Web APIs
- Use appropriate Web APIs for enhanced functionality.
- Implement proper feature detection and fallbacks.
- Use intersection observers for performance optimization.
- Implement proper error handling for API calls.
- Follow progressive enhancement principles.
