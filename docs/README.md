# Documentation Index

This directory contains organized code snippets, patterns, and examples across multiple technologies and domains.

## Language & Technology Categories

### Programming Languages

- [**C#**](csharp/README.md) - Comprehensive C# patterns, async/concurrency, caching, performance optimization, and more
- [**JavaScript**](javascript/README.md) - Modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns and utilities
- [**Python**](python/README.md) - Python scripting and automation patterns
- [**SQL**](sql/README.md) - Database queries and optimization techniques

### System & Tools

- [**Algorithms**](algorithms/README.md) - Data structures, sorting, searching, and algorithm implementations
- [**Bash**](bash/README.md) - Shell scripting and command-line utilities
- [**CMD**](cmd/README.md) - Windows Command Prompt and batch scripting
- [**Docker**](docker/README.md) - Containerization patterns and configurations
- [**Git**](git/README.md) - Version control workflows and advanced techniques
- [**PowerShell**](powershell/README.md) - Windows automation and scripting

### Development Patterns

- [**Design Patterns**](design-patterns/README.md) - Gang of Four patterns with comprehensive C# implementations
- [**Utilities**](utilities/README.md) - Cross-platform utilities and tools
- [**Web**](web/README.md) - Web development patterns and examples

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a dual-structure approach:

- **`docs/`** - Markdown documentation organized by technology (this section)
- **`src/`** - Executable C# library with reusable patterns and utilities
- **`tests/`** - xUnit test suite for the C# library

Each category contains focused examples with detailed explanations, usage patterns, and best practices.

## Getting Started

1. Browse categories by technology or domain
2. Each folder contains a README.md with an index of available snippets
3. Individual snippet files follow a consistent template with description, code, usage examples, and notes
4. The C# library in `src/` provides production-ready implementations of key patterns

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on adding new snippets and maintaining code quality standards.
