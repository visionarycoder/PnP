# Software Architecture Best Practices

## 1. Purpose

Provide scalable, maintainable, and evolvable systems that align with business goals.

## 2. Core Principles

- Favor modularity and separation of concerns.
- Design for change (volatility-based decomposition).
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Document decisions with ADRs.

## 3. Industry Standards & Frameworks

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- TOGAF
- C4 Model for architecture diagrams

## 4. Common Patterns

- Microservices vs. modular monolith
- Hexagonal / Clean Architecture
- Event-driven systems

## 5. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Big Ball of Mud
- God classes
- Over-engineering with unnecessary abstractions

## 6. Tooling & Ecosystem

- .NET, Java Spring, Node.js frameworks
- Architecture decision record (ADR) tooling
- Static analysis tools

## 7. Emerging Trends

- Serverless-first architectures
- AI-assisted design validation
- Event mesh and data mesh convergence

## 8. Architecture Decision Guidance

- Use microservices only when independent scaling and deployment are required.
- Involve specialists for distributed systems complexity.
